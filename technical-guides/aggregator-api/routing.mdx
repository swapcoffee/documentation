## How our routing works

1. You provide the input token, the output token and the amount you want to swap.
2. We build the optimal route for you. This route can be direct `(input token -> output token)` or
indirect `(input token -> token1 -> token2 -> ... -> output token)`. By splitting the amount of the input token between
several liquidity pools on several decentralized exchanges (**DeDust**, **STONfi**, etc), we can reduce the price impact
and get a better price for you.
3. We build the transactions that will swap the tokens.
4. You send the transactions to the blockchain.
5. If slippage is tolerated or deadline exceeds (in rare cases of blockchain lags), the transaction is being (possibly partially) reverted.
Otherwise, you receive the output token in your wallet.

## Basic usage

Swapping assets using our SDK and TonConnect SDK:

```typescript
import {ApiTokenAddress, RoutingApi} from "@swap-coffee/sdk";
import TonConnect, {WalletInfo, WalletInfoRemote} from "@tonconnect/sdk";

const connector = await setupTonConnect()
const routingApi = new RoutingApi()

const assetIn: ApiTokenAddress = {
    blockchain: "ton",
    address: "native" // stands for TON
}
const assetOut: ApiTokenAddress = {
    blockchain: "ton",
    address: "EQCl0S4xvoeGeFGijTzicSA8j6GiiugmJW5zxQbZTUntre-1" // CES
}

const input_amount = 5 // 5 TON

// let's build an optimal route
const route = await routingApi.buildRoute({
    input_token: assetIn,
    output_token: assetOut,
    input_amount: input_amount,
})

// then we can build transactions payload
const transactions = await routingApi.buildTransactionsV2({
    sender_address: connector.account?.address!!, // address of user's wallet
    slippage: 0.1, // 10% slippage
    paths: route.data.paths,
})

let messages = []

for (const transaction of transactions.data.transactions) {
    // swap.coffee takes care of all the boring stuff here :)
    messages.push({
        address: transaction.address,
        amount: transaction.value,
        payload: transaction.cell,
    })
}

// just send the transaction to the user
await connector.sendTransaction({
    validUntil: Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000,
    messages: messages,
})
```

## Advanced usage

There are extra settings that you're able to modify in case you want more control over how routes are built.

The following parameters can be configured:

- <code>max_length</code> - maximum path length in tokens, default is **3**. If specified, it must be an integer from **[2; 5]** range. Value of **2** indicates that route can contain only direct-swaps paths `(input token -> output token)`. Value of **3**, however, states that route may also contain paths with one intermediate token `(input token -> token1 -> output token)`.

```typescript
const route = await routingApi.buildRoute({
    input_token: assetIn,
    output_token: assetOut,
    input_amount: input_amount,
    max_length: 4 // allow up to 2 intermediate tokens
});
```

- <code>max_splits</code> - maximum number of splits, default is **4**. If specified, it must be an integer from **[1; 20]** range. Each split is a distinct path, therefore a distinct blockchain-message that will need to be sent. Currently, wallet contract implementations up to version **4** support not more than **4** messages in a single transaction. Starting from version **5**, the number of message in a single transaction has been raise to **255** `(but ours upper limit is 20)`.

```typescript
const route = await routingApi.buildRoute({
    input_token: assetIn,
    output_token: assetOut,
    input_amount: input_amount,
    max_splits: 2
});
```

- <code> pool_selector </code> is an optional property that allows you to control which liquidity pools can be used whilst building the route.

   - `blockchains` - allows you to limit liquidity pools to given blockchains only. Currently **swap.coffee** does not support cross-chain swaps, but who knows what will happen tomorrow ðŸ™‚ If you're certain that you won't like performing cross-chain swaps in the future, set this property to **["ton"]** value. By default, all supported blockchains are used.
   - `dexes` - allows you to limit liquidity pools to given dexes only. By default, all supported DEXes are used.
   - `max_volatility` - allows you to filter out those liquidity pools, whose price volatility over the last 15 minutes exceeded the given value. The higher the value, the more volatile liquidity pools may be used.

## Difference between direct and indirect routes

Direct routes without intermediate tokens are usually more safe, but less profitable. Indirect routes with intermediate tokens are usually more profitable, but less safe, because the price of intermediate tokens can change during the transaction and chance that your may receive intermediate tokens instead of the desired output token is higher.

It's called **"slippage"** - the difference between the expected price and the actual price. For example, when you set `slippage` to **0.1**, it means that transaction within blockchain must be aborted if any of the swaps lead to obtaining less than `1 - 0.1 = 0.9 = 90%` of amount predicted by **swap.coffee** backend in returned **route**. Due to async nature of **TON** blockchain, such `slippage` abortion can also lead to a situation where the sender is left with neither the input nor the output tokens, but an intermediate one.

There are also tokens that can't be swapped directly, because they don't share a liquidity pool. Therefore, if you setup parameters so that only direct swaps allowed (i.e. if `max_length` is equal to **2**), an empty route will be built for you.

## ExactOut swaps

If you want to receive an exact amount of output tokens, you can specify the `output_amount` parameter. Those swaps, in comparison to direct swaps (when you specify `input_amount` instead), may be significantly less profitable. They also do not support splitting, which means that resulting route (if exists) will always contain a single path.

```typescript
const route = await routingApi.buildRoute({
    input_token: assetIn,
    output_token: assetOut,
    output_amount: 200 // desired amount of output token
});
```

## Multi-asset swaps

Sometimes you might want to exchange multiple input assets for a single output asset in one operation. A common use case is swapping various tokens from your balance into a primary asset like TON or USDT.

swap.coffee supports this scenario throuh **Multi-asset swap** feature.

To use this feature via sdk, you'll need `buildMultiAssetRoute` function of the `RoutingApi`. This function is similar to its single-asset counterpart (`buildRoute`), but designed for multiple inputs.

Here are the key differences from `buildRoute`:
1. Input parameters:
    - Instead of `input_token: ApiTokenAddress` and `input_amount: number`, `buildMultiAssetRoute` accepts a single `input_assets` parameter.
    - `input_assets` is an array of `ApiMultiAssetInputAsset` object, where each one has the following structure: \
      `{ asset: ApiTokenAddress, amount: number }` \
      This allows you to specify each input token and its corresponding amount.
    - `buildMultiAssetRoute` does not support `output_amount` field.
2. Return value structure:
    - `buildMultiAssetRoute` returns an `ApiMultiAssetRoute` object.
    - The `ApiRoute` object (returned by `buildRoute`) describes a single swap operation and contains fields like `input_token`, `output_token`, `input_amount`, `output_amount`, and `paths`.
    - The `ApiMultiAssetRoute` object (returned by `buildMultiAssetRoute`) aggregates information for the multi-asset swap:
        - It contains a `routes: ApiRoute[]` field. Each element here is an `ApiRoute` object, representing one part of the multi-asset swap.
        - It contains an `output_token: ApiToken` field, representing a single output token of the multi-asset swap.
        - It provides aggregated totals like `total_output_amount`, `total_savings`, `total_estimated_cashback_usd`, etc., summing up corresponding values from all individual routes.

Here's how you can use `buildMultiAssetRoute` to swap both TON and USDT for CES:

```typescript
import {ApiTokenAddress, RoutingApi} from "@swap-coffee/sdk";

const connector = await setupTonConnect()
const routingApi = new RoutingApi()

const assetTon: ApiTokenAddress = {
    blockchain: "ton",
    address: "native" // stands for TON
}
const assetUsdt: ApiTokenAddress = {
    blockchain: "ton",
    address: "EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs" // USDT
}
const assetOut: ApiTokenAddress = {
    blockchain: "ton",
    address: "EQCl0S4xvoeGeFGijTzicSA8j6GiiugmJW5zxQbZTUntre-1" // CES
}

// let's build an optimal route
const route = await routingApi.buildMultiAssetRoute({
    input_assets: [
        {
            token: assetTon,
            amount: 1.0
        },
        {
            token: assetUsdt,
            amount: 2.0
        }
    ],
    output_asset: assetOut
})

// then we can build transactions payload
const transactions = await routingApi.buildTransactionsV2({
    sender_address: connector.account?.address!!, // address of user's wallet
    slippage: 0.1, // 10% slippage
    paths: route.data.routes.flatMap(it => it.paths), // collect all splits
})
```

## MEV Protection

You can enable MEV protection, which protects user's swaps from the so-called sandwich attacks: a MEV bot buys the token before your trade and sells it immediately afterward, causing you to purchase at a higher price. By enabling MEV protection, you can ensure that swaps are not only secure but also maximally profitable.

Note that we charge an additional fee for each split in the swap. However, this fee should be absolutely justified when swapping large amounts of liquidity.

Be aware that enabling MEV protection will exclude the following DEXes from the routing due to their technical limitations:
- STON.fi (v1 only)

To enable MEV protection, you have to pass an extra parameters to our API:

```typescript
const route = await routingApi.buildRoute({
    // the rest of the parameters
    // ...
    mev_protection: true
});

const transactions = await routingApi.buildTransactionsV2({
    // the rest of the parameters
    // ...
    mev_protection: true
})
```

That's it. MEV protection is enabled, and our system will take care of the rest to maximize the profit from the swap.

## Checking transaction results

Along with the transaction built, you receive the `route_id` field. It can be used to check the result of the route's transactions on the **blockchain**.

### Basic usage

**SDK** contains inbuilt method for waiting execution results of route's transactions. Promise will be resolved when all transactions are in terminal status (one of `succeeded`, `failed` or `timed_out`).

```typescript
import {ApiTokenAddress, RoutingApi, waitForTransactionResults} from "@swap-coffee/sdk";

const connector = await setupTonConnect();
const routingApi = new RoutingApi();

const assetIn: ApiTokenAddress = {
  blockchain: 'ton',
  address: 'native', // stands for TON
};
const assetOut: ApiTokenAddress = {
  blockchain: 'ton',
  address: 'EQCl0S4xvoeGeFGijTzicSA8j6GiiugmJW5zxQbZTUntre-1', // CES
};

const route = await routingApi.buildRoute({
  input_token: assetIn,
  output_token: assetOut,
  input_amount: 5, // 5 TON
});

const transactions = await routingApi.buildTransactionsV2({
  sender_address: connector.account?.address!!,
  slippage: 0.1,
  paths: route.data.paths, // note: use route.data here
});


let messages = [];

for (const transaction of transactions.data.transactions) {
  messages.push({
    address: transaction.address,
    amount: transaction.value,
    payload: transaction.cell,
  });
}

await connector.sendTransaction({
  validUntil: Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000,
  messages: messages,
});

const results = await waitForTransactionResults(transactions.data.route_id, routingApi);

for (const result of results) {
  // handle result for each route's paths
}
```

### Advanced usage
By passing `route_id` into `getTransactionsResult()` you can obtain current state of the route's transactions execution status. Response is as follows:

```typescript
[
  {
    "status": "TX_STATUS",
    "steps": [
      {
        "status": "SWAP_STATUS",
        "input": {
          "token_blockchain": "ton",
          "token_address": "EQ...1",
          "amount": 1.2345
        },
        "output": {
          "token_blockchain": "ton",
          "token_address": "EQ...2",
          "amount": 2.3456
        }
      }
    ],
    "input": {
      "token_blockchain": "ton",
      "token_address": "EQ...1",
      "amount": 1.2345
    },
    "output": {
      "token_blockchain": "ton",
      "token_address": "EQ...2",
      "amount": 2.3456
    }
  }
]
```

Each element of the returned array corresponds to a path at the same index that you provided `buildTransactionsV2`
method with.

Each element of the `steps` corresponds to a single swap within transaction. For example, if transaction is
`A -> B -> C`, then first entry in steps describes `A -> B` swap, and the second one describes `B -> C`.

- `TX_STATUS` is a status of a single transaction (related to a single path):
  * `pending` indicates that none of transaction's swaps have occurred in the blockchain yet.
  * `partially_complete` - some (but not all) of transaction's swaps have occurred in the blockchain.
  * `succeeded` - all of transaction's swaps have successfully executed in blockchain.
  * `failed` - one of transaction's swaps has been aborted due to slippage tolerance.
  * `timed_out` - our service could not wait enough for at least one of transaction's swaps to be present in the
blockchain. This happens if more than 5 minutes have passed since the transaction was generated by our service
until the user sent it, or if more than 3 minutes have passed since the previous swap for this transaction
appeared in the blockchain.
- `SWAP_STATUS` is a status of a single swap within a transaction:
  * `pending` indicates that this swap didn't happen yet.
  * `cancelled` - swap has been cancelled due to one of the previous swaps within same transaction failure or timeout.
  * `succeeded` - swap successfully executed.
  * `failed` - swap has been aborted due to slippage tolerance.
  * `timed_out` - our service could not wait enough for this swap to be present in the blockchain.
- Transaction's `input` and `output` fields are presented only if at least one swap has already moved to status
`succeeded` or `failed`.
- Swap's `input` and `output` fields are presented only if swap's status is `succeeded` or `failed`. On failure
(abortion due to slippage tolerance) `output` is equal to `input`.

The route status can be requested within 2 hours from the moment `route_id` (and transactions) is generated via
`buildTransactionsV2`.

If all transactions are in terminal status (one of `succeeded`, `failed` or `timed_out`), further receipt of this
route's status will be possible only for 1 minute, after which it will be invalidated from our service's cache.

## Custom fees (for partners only)

Starting January 2025 various DEXes stopped sharing their fees with aggregators like **swap.coffee**.
We understand the desire of our partners to continue earning on user transactions, and therefore we provide
functionality for charging additional fees.

To do so, it is enough to pass the `custom_fee` property to the transaction construction method:
```typescript
// building the route itself
const route = await routingApi.buildRoute({
    input_token: assetIn,
    output_token: assetOut,
    input_amount: input_amount,
    max_splits: 3 // Important! Please, continue reading to understand why
})

// building transactions of the route
const transactions = await routingApi.buildTransactionsV2({
    sender_address: connector.account?.address!!, // address of user's wallet
    slippage: 0.1, // 10% slippage
    paths: route.data.paths,
    referral_name: '#YOUR_REFERRAL_NAME#',
    custom_fee: {
        fixed_fee: 'value',
        percentage_fee: 'value',
        min_percentage_fee_fixed: 'value',
        max_percentage_fee_fixed: 'value'
    }
})
```

As you can see, there are multiple opportunities to set up custom fees collection. Let's dive into them!

First of all, `custom_fee` specification looks as follows:
```typescript
export interface ApiTransactionsCustomFee {
    /**
     * Value in nanotons
     * @type {string}
     * @memberof ApiTransactionsCustomFee
     */
    'fixed_fee'?: string;
    /**
     * Value in 1/1000000: 1 is 0.0001%, 1000000 is 100%. If present, can not be less than 10000000 (0.01 TON)
     * @type {number}
     * @memberof ApiTransactionsCustomFee
     */
    'percentage_fee'?: number;
    /**
     * Value in nanotons. No less than this value may be withdrawn as a percentage_fee. Must be set if percentage_fee is present. Can not be less than 10000000 (0.01 TON)
     * @type {string}
     * @memberof ApiTransactionsCustomFee
     */
    'min_percentage_fee_fixed'?: string;
    /**
     * Value in nanotons. If set, no more than this value may be withdrawn as a percentage_fee. Taken into account only if percentage_fee is present
     * @type {string}
     * @memberof ApiTransactionsCustomFee
     */
    'max_percentage_fee_fixed'?: string;
}
```

You can charge fixed, volume-percentage based or even both fees every time user performs a swap throughout your service.
Each method adds additional transaction to the list given to the user for signing. Regardless of the method chosen and
tokens of the swap, fees are always charged in TONs.

Please, keep in mind that whatever value you set, it is not the amount you will receive: all custom fees are divided
equally between our partners and **swap.coffee** itself, which means that you will get only half of what you request
from users there.

### Fixed fee

This method is for those cases when you want to charge the same level of commission on all trades through your service,
regardless of the trade volume. Please keep in mind that `fixed_fee` is specified in nano-TONs and must not be less than
`10_000_000`, which equals 0.01 TON.

### Volume-percentage based fee

If you want to charge more commission the larger the trade the user makes, this method is for you.
`percentage_fee` is specified in a parts on `1/1_000_000`: `1` stands for `0.0001%` and `1_000_000` stands for `100%`.

Whilst using this method, you must also specify `min_percentage_fee_fixed` property, which, as much as `fixed_fee`,
must not be less than `10_000_000`, which equals 0.01 TON. It is also up to you whether you want to limit fee value
from the above by setting `max_percentage_fee_fixed` property.

Overall, the final formula for volume-percentage based fee is as follows:
```
ref_fee = max(
    max_percentage_fee_fixed,
    min(
        min_percentage_fee_fixed,
        volume_usdt * percentage_fee / 1_000_000
    )
)
```

### Thinking of max splits

Because of custom fees being withdrawn as a separate transactions, it is very important to keep in mind that wallet
contracts have a limitation of how much transactions they may send at once: no more than 4 for walletV4 and no more
than 255 for walletV5.

That's why, when adding custom fees, you **must** guarantee that the route for which you are building transactions
contains no more than `max_wallet_txs - 1` splits: it is configurable during `buildRoute` invocation (as shown above).

Default value of `max_splits` for `buildRoute` is 4. So, if you haven't specified that property before, it's time to
start doing so. If you have tools to determine user's wallet version, you may set it to `3` for walletV4 and to `20`
for walletV5. Otherwise, you can just leave it at `3`, because in most circumstances this is more than enough for a
good route to be built.
