## Installation

For JavaScript/TypeScript please use the SDK as stated below:

```bash
npm install @swap-coffee/sdk
```

For any other languages, you can integrate with our [Rest API](https://backend.swap.coffee/swagger-ui) directly.

## Concepts

Here are some basic concepts you need to know to work with our SDK:

- **Asset**: an asset is a token on a blockchain. It can be a native token (like **TON** on TON blockchain) or a token on a smart contract, named `jetton` (like **USDT** on **TON blockchain**). Each asset has a unique address on the blockchain.
- **Route**: a route is a set of paths.
- **Path**: a path is a list of tokens (or, more specifically, of liquidity pools) that can be swapped one to another. For example, if you want to swap **TON** to **USDT**, you can do it directly `(TON -> USDT)` or you can do it in two steps ``(TON -> CES -> USDT)``. The first path has one swap, the second path has two swaps.
- **Price impact**: when you perform a swap, the price of the token can change. The price impact depends on the amount you want to swap and the liquidity of the token. If you swap a small amount, the price impact will be low. If you swap a large amount, the price impact will be high.
- **Price slippage**: the price of a token can change over time. When you swap tokens, you can set a slippage tolerance. If the price of the token changes more than the slippage tolerance, the transaction will fail.
- **Transaction**: a transaction is a set of messages that are sent to the blockchain. Each message can be a token transfer, a contract call, etc. When you swap tokens, you need to build a transaction that will swap the tokens for you.

## API Limitations
Our API is public, which means it allows unauthorized access. However, this access has its limitations:

- `input_token` and `output_token` whilst building routes must be different, so you are not allowed to find cycles.
Moreover, none of the returned routes will contain cycles within them (so no paths like
`token1 -> token2 -> token1 -> token3` will be returned).
- We believe that the average load of 1 request per second per IP is more than acceptable. If you generate more, the API
will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.
- No product-specific features, such as in-depth analysis of your users trades, available.

If you are considering integration with our product, building an arbitrage service or generating a higher level of load,
please contact us via Telegram [@swap.coffee DEV Chat](https://t.me/swapcoffee_dev_chat) or get [API Key via Typeform.](https://swapcoffee.typeform.com/to/Zx49Ho3y)
