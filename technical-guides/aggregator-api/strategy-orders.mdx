## Essential knowledge

All of swap.coffee's orders, regardless of their type, utilize the same **Strategy Orders Service** API
(available both at our [Rest API endpoint](https://backend.swap.coffee/swagger-ui#/Strategies) or within our SDK).

To start your integration journey throughout our SDK, here's a useful code snippet:
```typescript
import {StrategiesApi} from "@swap-coffee/sdk";

const strategiesApi = new StrategiesApi()
```

Our service of working with strategy orders is organized in a fairly simple way:
1. For each user we deploy a so-called **Strategies Wallet** that is being administrated by our backend systems.
2. Whenever user decides to create a new order or edit an existing one, he transfers funds and sends an associated
message to that contract. Therefore, all the information about user's orders and interactions is stored within blockchain:
not as a separate contract for each order, but in a single contract for all of them.
3. Our backend systems perform strategies-related logic and build routes off-chain, then initiate both exchange- and
order-ending transactions on the wallet contract deployed in step (1).

## Strategies wallet

First of all, in order to interact with strategies service, user needs to create his very own **Strategies Wallet**.
This is a one-time action.

```typescript
import TonConnect from "@tonconnect/sdk";

const connector = await setupTonConnect()

// First, we retrieve a transaction for strategies wallet creation.
const tx = await strategiesApi.getStrategyWalletCreationTransaction(
    'USER_WALLET_ADDRESS',
    'USER_WALLET_VERIFICATION_TOKEN'
)

// Then sending this transaction via TonConnect.
await connector.sendTransaction({
    validUntil: Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000,
    messages: [{
        address: tx.data.address,
        amount: tx.data.value,
        payload: tx.data.payload_cell,
        stateInit: tx.data.state_init
    }]
})

// And finally, we wait until strategies wallet is being created.
while (true) {
    const created = await strategiesApi.doesStrategyWalletExist(
    'USER_WALLET_ADDRESS',
    'USER_WALLET_VERIFICATION_TOKEN'
    )
    if (created.status != 404) {
        console.log('Created strategies wallet address is', created.data)
        break
    }
}
```

### Wallet verification token

Many of our API methods may require a mandatory parameter `xVerify`. This is a special json-formatted string that
confirms ownership of the associated wallet.

The easiest way to obtain it is to authorize with your wallet at [our website](https://swap.coffee/limit) and to
steal it from within browser's network profiling page (it will be in sent-headers section).

The manual way to generate it is to authenticate `swap.coffee` domain using **Ton Connect**. More details about it
available in [their documentation](https://ton-connect.github.io/sdk/modules/_tonconnect_sdk.html#backend-authorization).

## Creating your first order

After strategies wallet has been created, you are free to use the full power of our strategies service any way you want it.

Firstly, you need to decide for which pair of assets you are going to create an order. Unlike regular route building,
orders can not be created for an arbitrary set of pairs. What we do instead is:
```typescript
const fromAssets = await strategiesApi.getFromTokensEligibleForStrategies(
    'limit' // Pick appropriate type for your order.
)
for (const fromAsset of fromAssets.data) {
    const toAssets = await strategiesApi.getToTokensEligibleForStrategies('limit', fromAsset)
    for (const toAsset of toAssets.data) {
        console.log('Limit order can be created for assets', fromAsset, toAsset)
    }
}
```

After you checked that the pair of assets you wanted to create the order for is indeed supported, it is time to create
the order itself:
```typescript
// Build transaction for order creation.
const tx = await strategiesApi.getStrategyOrderCreationTransaction(
    'USER_WALLET_ADDRESS',
    'USER_WALLET_VERIFICATION_TOKEN',
    {
        type: 'limit',
        token_from: {
            blockchain: 'ton',
            address: fromAsset
        },
        token_to: {
            blockchain: 'ton',
            address: toAsset
        },
        input_amount: "VALUE", // Absolute amount of input asset. For example, 1000000000 will be used for 1 TON.
        max_suborders: 1,
        max_invocations: 1,
        slippage: 1,
        settings
    }
)

// Then send this tx using ton-connect.
```

### Order settings

There are some non-obvious parameters in this request that require further explanation:
- `max_suborders` - maximum amount of sub-orders this order may be split into. Must be within bounds `[1; 255]`.
- `max_invocations` - maximum amount of sub-orders execution tries. Must be within bounds `[max_suborders; 255].
What we mean by _try_ here is as follows:
    - If sub-order executes successfully, it consumes one _try_, and order execution continues as planned;
    - Otherwise (if sub-order couldn't be fulfilled due to slippage toleration, deadline exceeding, etc), -
it also consumes one _try_, but checks if there are any available _tries_ left: if yes, sub-order will be retried (consuming one more _try_);
if no, the whole order will be cancelled at the current stage of execution (possibly marked as only partially fulfilled).
- `slippage` - this term means the same as in normal routing construction, but for **LIMIT** orders (when the system
must guarantee that the order will be filled at no less than the user's requested price) it also affects how much the
price must exceed the user's requested price before the order will be attempted to be filled.
For example, `0.001` (0.1%) value set for **LIMIT** order, in which user wants to exchange 1 TON for at least 10 USDT,
means that order will be executed when price reaches at least `10 * (1 + 0.001) = 10 * 1.001 = 10.01` USDT for 1 TON.
Must be within bounds `(0; 1]`.
- `settings` is the only field that is truly unique for each order type. Below it is analyzed in detail.

For limit orders:
```typescript
{
  min_output_amount: "VALUE" // Absolute amount of output asset to be minimally received.
}
```

For DCA orders:
```typescript
{
    delay: 60, // Delay in seconds between DCA order executions. Must be within bounds [60; 15552000].
    price_range_from: 0.0, // Optional. Allows to prohibit the execution of an order if the price falls below the specified level.
    price_range_to: 0.0 // Optional. Allows to prohibit the execution of an order if the price rises above the specified level.
}
```

## Looking after existing orders

There are 2 methods for retrieving your orders information: `getStrategyOrder` that looks for specific order identifier,
and `getStrategyOrders` that supports filtering and allows to get data for multiple orders at once.

Both of those methods return structure known as `StrategyOrder`, which looks as follows:
```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "type": "limit",
  "wallet": "string",
  "status": "active",
  "creation_timestamp": 0,
  "token_from": {
    "address": {
      "blockchain": "ton",
      "address": "native"

    }
  },
  "token_to": {
    "address": {

    }
  },
  "initial_input_amount": "string",
  "current_input_amount": "string",
  "settings": {
    "additionalProp1": "string",
    "additionalProp2": "string",
    "additionalProp3": "string"
  },
  "current_output_amount": "string",
  "max_suborders": 0,
  "suborders_executed": 0,
  "max_invocations": 0,
  "invocations_executed": 0,
  "slippage": 0.0,
  "max_path_length": 0,

}
```

Please, keep in mind that both `current_input_amount` and `current_output_amount` include fees to be withdrawn by our service (if any).
Currently, there is no API functionality that allows to distinct funds to be sent to the user and service fees.

## Order cancellation

Given an existing order in `active` status, user is able to cancel it by calling appropriate method:
```typescript
// Get transaction for order cancellation.
const fromAssets = await strategiesApi.getStrategyOrderCancellationTransaction(
    'USER_WALLET_ADDRESS',
    'USER_WALLET_VERIFICATION_TOKEN',
    42 // order identifier
)

// Then execute it via ton-connect.
```
