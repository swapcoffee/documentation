# Introduction

Tokens in the swap.coffee platform can have associated staking pools. The staking pool information is represented by the `stakingPool` object, which contains details about the staking pool, such as the address, name, APY, and other relevant information.
Currently, we collect staking information for the following tokens:


* hTON (Hipo Staked TON) - https://hipo.finance
* tsTON (Tonstakers) - https://tonstakers.com
* stTON (Bemo) - https://bemo.fi

The API located at https://tokens.swap.coffee/docs

For example, for stTON (Bemo), the staking pool object looks like this:
```json
{
  "address": "0:cd872fa7c5816052acdf5332260443faec9aacc8c21cca4d92e7f47034d11892",

# Transaction Builder API

swap.coffee provides API endpoints for building stake and unstake transactions for staked tokens. These functionality
eliminate the need for users to manually construct transactions.

### Stake Transactions

To build a transaction for staking TON tokens, use the following endpoint:

```
POST https://backend.swap.coffee/v2/stake/ton/transaction
```

This endpoint returns a pre-built transaction for the given stake request. The transaction must be signed and sent by the sender via their wallet.

#### Request Parameters

The stake transaction endpoint requires a JSON request body with the following parameters:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| sender_address | string | Yes | The address of the sender who will sign and send the transaction |
| amount | number | Yes | The amount of TON tokens to stake |
| token_address | string | Yes | The address of the staking pool token (e.g., stTON, hTON, tsTON) |
| referral_name | string | No | Optional referral name for tracking purposes |

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://backend.swap.coffee/v2/stake/ton/transaction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sender_address": "UQCNTO0Nh0Z7QNyRW1BLWfk08f2dAOw4izrx9sO6OUPg4DoV",
    "amount": 0.05,
    "token_address": "EQDY6PMeMbQSz7dltNN4RRTIxyuBJX4dQESOy8cWR2tUgBxH"
  }'
```

#### Response Structure

The endpoint returns a response with the following structure:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| payload_cell | string (base64) | Yes | Base64-encoded cell that is treated as a payload field in TonConnect transaction |
| address | string | Yes | The address of the contract to interact with |
| value | string (int128) | Yes | Amount of nanotons to be sent with the transaction |
| state_init | string (base64) | No | Optional base64-encoded cell that is treated as a stateInit field in TonConnect transaction |

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "payload_cell": "te6cckEBAQEAcQAA3v8AIN0gggFMl7ohggEznLqxn3Gw7UTQ0x/THzHXC//jBOCk8mCDCNcYINMf0x/TH/gjE7vyY+1E0NMf0x/T/9FRMrryoVFEuvKiBPkBVBBV+RDyo/gAkyDXSpbTB9QC+wDo0QGkyMsfyx/L/8ntVBC9ba0=",
  "address": "EQCM3B12QK1e4yZSf8GtBRT0aLMNyEsBc_DhVfRRtOEffLez",
  "value": "100000000"
}
```

### Unstake Transactions

To build a transaction for unstaking TON tokens, use the following endpoint:

```
POST https://backend.swap.coffee/v2/unstake/ton/transaction
```

This endpoint returns a pre-built transaction for the given unstake request. The transaction must be signed and sent by the sender via their wallet.

#### Request Parameters

The unstake transaction endpoint requires a JSON request body with the following parameters:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| sender_address | string | Yes | The address of the sender who will sign and send the transaction |
| amount | number | Yes | The amount of staked tokens to unstake |
| token_address | string | Yes | The address of the staking pool token (e.g., stTON, hTON, tsTON) |
| referral_name | string | No | Optional referral name for tracking purposes |

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://backend.swap.coffee/v2/unstake/ton/transaction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sender_address": "UQCNTO0Nh0Z7QNyRW1BLWfk08f2dAOw4izrx9sO6OUPg4DoV",
    "amount": 0.05,
    "token_address": "EQDY6PMeMbQSz7dltNN4RRTIxyuBJX4dQESOy8cWR2tUgBxH"
  }'
```

#### Response Structure

The endpoint returns a response with the following structure:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| payload_cell | string (base64) | Yes | Base64-encoded cell that is treated as a payload field in TonConnect transaction |
| address | string | Yes | The address of the contract to interact with |
| value | string (int128) | Yes | Amount of nanotons to be sent with the transaction |
| state_init | string (base64) | No | Optional base64-encoded cell that is treated as a stateInit field in TonConnect transaction |

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "payload_cell": "te6cckEBAQEAcQAA3v8AIN0gggFMl7ohggEznLqxn3Gw7UTQ0x/THzHXC//jBOCk8mCDCNcYINMf0x/TH/gjE7vyY+1E0NMf0x/T/9FRMrryoVFEuvKiBPkBVBBV+RDyo/gAkyDXSpbTB9QC+wDo0QGkyMsfyx/L/8ntVBC9ba0=",
  "address": "EQCM3B12QK1e4yZSf8GtBRT0aLMNyEsBc_DhVfRRtOEffLez",
  "value": "100000000"
}
```

## Using the built message with TonConnect

This transaction information can be used with wallet providers like TonConnect to execute the stake or unstake operation. Here's an example of how to use the response with TonConnect:

```javascript
const transaction = {
  validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 360, // 5 minutes from now
  messages: [
    {
      address: response.address,
      amount: response.value,
      payload: response.payload_cell
    }
  ]
};

// Send the transaction using TonConnect
tonConnectUi.sendTransaction(transaction);
```
