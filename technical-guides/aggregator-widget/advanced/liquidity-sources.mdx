title: 'Liquidity Sources'
description: 'Configure which liquidity providers the widget is allowed to use for swap routing.'
---

By default, `swap.coffee UI widget` supports a **full list of decentralized protocols** and automatically evaluates them at runtime.

---

## Default Behavior

If you **do not provide** any liquidity-related configuration, the widget enables `all available sources`:

```typescript
['tonco', 'stonfi_v2', 'tonstakers', 'stonfi', 'dedust']
```

These are fully **dynamic** and **toggleable** by the user in the widget UI under expert settings.

## Restricting Liquidity Sources

You can **override this behavior** by passing the `liquiditySourcesList` parameter.

```typescript
liquiditySourcesList?: string[];
```

  - When this list is provided, **only the specified sources are used**, and the user **cannot change or toggle** them via the UI.

### Example: Restrict to a Single Source

```typescript
createSwapWidget("#test", {
  liquiditySourcesList: ["stonfi_v2"],
  otherConfig...
});
```

This limits swap routing **strictly** to `STONFI_V2`.
All other sources like `TONCO` or `Tonstakers` **are excluded from routing and hidden in the UI**.

> ðŸš« When `liquiditySourcesList` is set, the widget **hides off settings for sources**.
Users **will no longer** be able to change `liquidity source` preferences **inside the widget**.
