### How to Listen our Events

To listen for these **events** on the client side, you can use the `addEventListener` method. Here's how you can listen `event_route_built` event as example:

```typescript

// Event listener for the 'event_route_built' event

window.addEventListener('event_route_built', (event) => {
  console.log('Route build, details:', event.detail);
});

```
