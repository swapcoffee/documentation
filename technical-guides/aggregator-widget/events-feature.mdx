## Overview

Each of these **events** provides critical information that can be used to monitor user interactions, improve platform functionality, and generate comprehensive analytics reports.

### Supported Events

Here are the events we currently support:

---

****event_route_built**** - ``Triggered when a route is built``.

****event_token_changed**** - ``Triggered when the selected token changes``.

****event_swap_settings_updated**** - ``Triggered when the swap settings are updated``.

****event_token_imported**** - ``Triggered when a token is imported``.

****event_transactions_built**** - ``Triggered when a set of transactions is built``.

****event_swap_result_received**** - ``Triggered when the swap result is received``.

### How to Listen our Events

To listen for these **events** on the client side, you can use the `addEventListener` method. Here's how you can listen `event_route_built` event as example:

```typescript

// Event listener for the 'event_route_built' event

window.addEventListener('event_route_built', (event) => {
  console.log('Route build, details:', event.detail);
});

```

### Event Detail

Each of these events carries additional data that can be accessed through `event.detail`. For example:

- **`event_route_built`**: Contains information about the route, including the tokens involved and estimated fees.
- **`event_token_changed`**: Contains the details of the token that has been changed.
- **`event_swap_settings_updated`**: Contains the updated swap settings.
- **`event_token_imported`**: Contains the details of the imported token.
- **`event_transactions_built`**: Contains the details of the built transactions.
- **`event_swap_result_received`**: Contains the result of the swap.

## Conclusion


By following the guidelines outlined in this documentation, you can effectively manage events such as route building, token changes, swap settings updates, and more.
