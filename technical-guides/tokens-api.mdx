**swap.coffee** constantly updates the list of tokens (or jettons for  **TON**) that are supported by the platform.
This list is used to determine the available tokens that can be used by our swap algorithms.
The list of tokens and their specific properties **(TVL, price, etc)** are collected from various sources and are updated on a regular basis.

You can use tokens from the list to swap them with other tokens or build your own logic on top of it.

**OpenAPI Specification for the tokens API** can be found [here](https://tokens.swap.coffee/api/v3/swagger-ui). You can build your own API wrapper by using the OpenAPI code generator.

If you here for v1 or v2 API, you can find it [here](https://tokens.swap.coffee/docs). But we recommend to use the latest version of the API, as it has more features and better performance.

## Token properties

Each token from the list has the following properties:

- **created_at**: The date and time when the token was added to the list.
- **address**: The blockchain address of the token contract.
- **total_supply**: The total supply of the token in raw format.
- **decimals**: The number of decimal places the token can be divided into.
- **mintable**: Indicates whether the token can be minted (true or false).
- **verification**: The verification status of the token (e.g., WHITELISTED).
- **name**: The name of the token.
- **symbol**: The symbol of the token (e.g., TON).
- **image_url**: A URL to the token's image.

Also, each token has market statistics, which include:
- **holders_count**: The number of unique holders of the token.
- **price_usd**: The current price of the token in USD.
- **price_change_5m**: The price change in the last 5 minutes (in percentage).
- **price_change_1h**: The price change in the last hour (in percentage).
- **price_change_6h**: The price change in the last 6 hours (in percentage).
- **price_change_24h**: The price change in the last 24 hours (in percentage).
- **volume_usd_24h**: The trading volume of the token in the last 24 hours in USD.
- **tvl_usd**: The total value locked (TVL) in USD.
- **fdmc**: The fully diluted market capitalization of the token in USD.
- **trust_score**: A trust score indicating the reliability of the token (0-100).

⚠️ **Note**: The `address` property is represented in raw format.

## Verification Status

The `verification` property indicates the verification status of the token. The possible values are:
- **WHITELISTED**: The token is verified and whitelisted by us. Such tokens are considered safe, and it used in swap.coffee routing
- **COMMUNITY**: The token contract hash is considered safe, but it is not used in swap.coffee routing.
- **UNKNOWN**: The token is not verified, and potentially can be unsafe.
- **BLACKLISTED**: The token is blacklisted and considered dangerous.

## Token Labels

The `labels` property is an array of labels that can be assigned to the token. Labels are used to categorize tokens and can include:

- **new**: The token is new and recently added to the platform (lasts for 7 days).
- **contest**: The token is part of a contest or promotion on swap.coffee.
- **cashback**: The token is eligible for cashback rewards when used in swaps on swap.coffee.
