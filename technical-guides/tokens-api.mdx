**swap.coffee** constantly updates its list of supported tokens (or jettons on **TON**).
This list determines which assets our swap algorithms can use.
Token data and their specific properties **(TVL, price, etc.)** are aggregated from various sources and refreshed regularly.

You can swap any token from the list for another or build your own logic on top of it.

The **OpenAPI Specification for the tokens API** is available [here](https://tokens.swap.coffee/api/v3/swagger-ui).
You can generate your own API wrapper with the OpenAPI code generator.

## Token properties

Each token entry includes the following fields:

- **created_at**: The date and time when the token was added to the list.
- **address**: Raw blockchain address of the token contract.
- **total_supply**: Total token supply in the base units.
- **decimals**: Number of decimal places the token supports.
- **mintable**: Indicates whether additional tokens can be minted (`true` | `false`).
- **verification**: Verification status (e.g., `WHITELISTED`).
- **name**: Token name.
- **symbol**: Token symbol (e.g., `TON`).
- **image_url**: URL of the token image.
- **market_stats**: Market statistics (see below).

Market statistics properties:
- **holders_count**: Number of unique token holders.
- **price_usd**: Current price in USD.
- **price_change_5m**: Price change over the last 5 minutes (percentage).
- **price_change_1h**: Price change over the last hour (percentage).
- **price_change_6h**: Price change over the last 6 hours (percentage).
- **price_change_24h**: Price change over the last 24 hours (percentage).

## Verification Status

The `verification` field reflects a token’s verification status. Possible values are:
- **WHITELISTED**: The token is verified and whitelisted by swap.coffee. These assets are considered safe and are used in routing. Such tokens are guaranteed to be fee-free.
- **COMMUNITY**: The token’s contract hash is deemed safe, but the asset is not included in swap.coffee routing. Such tokens are guaranteed to be fee-free.
- **UNKNOWN**: The token is unverified and may be unsafe.
- **BLACKLISTED**: The token is blacklisted and considered dangerous.

## Token Labels

The `labels` property is an array of strings that classify a token. Possible values include:
- **new**: The token was recently listed; the label remains for seven days.
- **contest**: The token participates in a contest or promotion on swap.coffee.
- **cashback**: Swapping this token on swap.coffee qualifies for cashback rewards.

## Listing Tokens

The [dedicated endpoint](https://tokens.swap.coffee/api/v3/swagger-ui#/Jettons/getJettonsList) retrieves jettons (up to 100 per request) and supports the following query parameters:
- **search**: A string used to filter jettons by name or symbol.
- **verification**: An array of verification statuses to filter the results. Accepted values: `WHITELISTED`, `COMMUNITY`, `UNKNOWN`, `BLACKLISTED`. If omitted, only `WHITELISTED` jettons are returned.
- **label_id**: An integer that filters jettons by a specific label ID.
- **page**: The page number for pagination (default: `1`).
- **size**: The number of jettons per page (default: `100`).

⚠️ **Note**: To specify multiple verification statuses, repeat the parameter in the query string, e.g. `verification=WHITELISTED&verification=COMMUNITY`.
