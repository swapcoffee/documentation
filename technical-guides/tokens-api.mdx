**swap.coffee** constantly updates the list of tokens (or jettons for  **TON**) that are supported by the platform.
This list is used to determine the available tokens that can be used by our swap algorithms.
The list of tokens and their specific properties **(TVL, price, etc)** are collected from various sources and are updated on a regular basis.

You can use tokens from the list to swap them with other tokens or build your own logic on top of it.

**OpenAPI Specification for the tokens API** can be found [here](https://tokens.swap.coffee/docs). You can build your own API wrapper by using the OpenAPI code generator.

## Token properties

Each token from the list has the following properties:

- **symbol**: the token symbol (e.g. **USDT**, **CES**, **TON**, etc.)
- **name**: the token name (e.g. **Tether**, **Toncoin**, **Scaleton**, etc.)
- **address**: the token address on the blockchain
- **decimals**: the number of decimals the token has
- **blockchain_id**: the blockchain `ID` where the token is located (for TON it is always `1`)
- **price_usd**: the price of the token in **USD**
- **tvl**: the total value locked in the token (in **USD**)
- **holders_count**: the number of holders of the token
- **image**: the `URL` of the token image

⚠️ **Note**: The `address` property is represented in raw format. You should convert it to a user-friendly format when using it in the swap.coffee DEX aggregator API.
