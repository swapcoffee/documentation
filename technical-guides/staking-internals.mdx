# Introduction

This page describes overall architecture and possible interactions with staking protocol developed by **swap.coffee**.

User-friendly interface is available at https://swap.coffee/stake, but this document is aiming at providing readers
with technical insights, TL-B schemes and others associated complexities.

At the time of writing this article, we only support staking protocol for our own product, but we also have plans and
are in the process of implementation (by the time you read this, it's likely already implemented) to support staking
protocol for partner products as well.

# Architecture

Staking protocol consists of 2 on-chain contracts: **Master** and **Vault**;
integral off-chain backend that is responsible for rewards calciulation;
and also interacts with **swap.coffee**'s rewards distribution system.

## Master Contract

**Master Contract** is used both for storing crucial data about protocol itself and
keeping funds that are being distributed as a rewards.
It is also fully compatible with NFT standard by supporting all related methods of NFT Collection.

You may retrieve staking-related information by calling contract's get method `get_stored_data`, which returns:

### 1. int `initialized`

1 for true, 0 for false.

### 2. slice `admin_address`

### 3. slice `distributor_address`

Technical wallet that is a part of **swap.coffee**'s rewards distribution system
and which serves as a proxy point for users which want to claim their staking rewards.

### 4. slice `vault_address`

Address of a staking **Vault Contract** associated with this **Master Contract**.

### 5. cell `state`

Cell of the following format:
```tl-b
state total_points:Coins next_nft_id:uint64 = State;
```

### 6. cell `rewards`

Contains information about the rewards that were (or being) distributed across all the users that
participate(d) in staking.

Cell is being represented as a cell-referencing dictionary, which can be read as follows:
```func
(cell data, int found) = rewards.udict_get_ref?(256, slice_hash(jetton_wallet));
if (found) {
  slice ds = data.begin_parse();
  int duration = ds~load_uint(64);
  int finish_at = ds~load_uint(64);
  int started_at = finish_at - duration;
  int reward_per_point = ds~load_coins();
}
```

Every time this cell is updated, external out message is being generated:
```tl-b
notify_reward#0xa9577f0 query_id:uint64 jetton_wallet:MsgAddressInt duration:uint64 finish_at:uint64 reward_rate:Coins = NotifyReward;
```

In the message above, `reward_rate` is being calculated in one of the following ways:
```func
int update_time = now();
if (update_time > previous_finish_at) {
  reward_rate = reward_total_amount / duration;
} else {
  reward_rate = mul_add_div_mod_r(previous_finish_at - update_time, reward_per_point, reward_total_amount, duration);
}
```

Simplified version of the code that allows you to calculate reward for specific staking position:
```func
int staking_position_points = 0; ;; fill with your value
int staking_position_created_at = 0; ;; fill with your value
int acquiring_at = now(); ;; fill with your value: time at which user decides to acquire his reward
int reward_rate = 0; ;; must be retrieved by catching external out message
int NORMALIZER = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000;

if (staking_position_created_at < updated_at) {
  ;; In real world things are a bit more complicated, because rewards distribution may be updated after
  ;; users' staking positions were created. Internally there's a mechanism that handles such updates
  ;; and recalculates every staking position's rewards accordingly.
  return 0;
}
if (acquiring_time > finish_at) {
  acquiring_time = finish_at;
}
int delta_time = acquiring_time - updated_at;
return reward_rate * delta_time * NORMALIZER * staking_position_points / total_points;
```

### 7. cell `jettons`

Unlike many other staking protocols, ours supports staking of not only one specific token, but of any
(pre-defined by the protocol administrator) set of them. One of the purposes of the **Master Contract** is to be
an entry point to retrieve list of such supported tokens, and this exact cell contains them.

Cell is being represented as a cell-referencing dictionary, which can be read as follows:
```func
(cell data, int found) = jettons.udict_get_ref?(256, slice_hash(jetton_wallet));
if (found) {
  slice ds = data.begin_parse();
  slice jetton_wallet = ds~load_msg_addr();
  int jetton_normalizer = ds~load_coins();
}
```

Only those jettons that are defined in this cell may be staked. Normalizer defines amount of points being accrued
for staking one piece of this jetton.

### 8. cell `periods`

Investment of funds is possible only for one of the predetermined periods, which are stored in this exact cell.

Cell is being represented as a cell-referencing dictionary, which can be read as follows:
```func
(cell data, int found) = periods.udict_get_ref?(32, period_id);
if (found) {
  slice ds = data.begin_parse();
  int duration = ds~load_uint(64);
  int percentage = ds~load_uint(64);
}
```

For a given period, user final points may be calculated as:
```func
  int base_points = jetton_staked_amount * jetton_normalizer;
  return mul_div_r(base_points, percentage, 100);
```

## Vault Contract

This contract serves both as a storage for users' staked assets and as a proxy for users' interactions with
the **Master Contract**.

### Deposit

New staking position may be created by sending jettons to the **Vault Contract** with specific `forward_payload`:
```tl-b
period period_id:uint32 = Period;
transfer#f8a7ea5 query_id:uint64 amount:(VarUInteger 16) destination_address:MsgAddress response_address:MsgAddress custom_payload:(Maybe ^Cell) forward_amount:(VarUInteger 16) forward_payload:(Maybe ^Period) = Transfer;
```

After such action, if succeeded, users' assets will be held until he decides to withdraw them
(after lock period expires), and NFT Item that corresponds to **Master Contract** as a NFT collection will be created
and sent to the user who initiated this transaction.

Example of full deposit transaction could be found [here](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/e25593795c06d898f2010761e910fdb1b9a63c6c3a1e431565e161412b05f758).

### Withdraw

Despite being written under **Vault Contract** section, withdrawal is performed by sending a specific transaction to
the NFT Item user received after staking his jettons. Message's body looks as follows:
```tl-b
close_staking_position#0xcb03bfaf query_id:uint64 = CloseStakingPosition;
```

If everything is ok, there will be a chain of messages initiated by the NFT Item that will go through the
**Master Contract** right to the **Vault Contract**, freeing user's assets.

## Off-Chain Backend

As briefly described before, our staking protocol hardly depends on the off-chain part that not only indexes blockchain
in order to track all the users actions related to staking, but also allows us to integrate staking protocol into
already existing **swap.coffee**'s rewards distribution system.

This is a closed proprietary product, therefore there is not really much to write about it.
Despite the fact that there are some interactions that users will encounter when using our staking protocol such as
rewards claiming, we're not ready yet to provide in-depth details about it. But stay tuned and maybe in some future
it will also appear on our documentation website :)
