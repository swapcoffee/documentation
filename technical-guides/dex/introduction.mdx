**swap.coffee DEX** is an [open-source](https://github.com/swapcoffee/dex) most powerful and extensible decentralized exchange **TON**-native protocol
on the TON blockchain. We truly believe that it signifies new era of both user exchanges and market evolution overall,
as it aims at not only providing the smoothest user experience by securing them in all possible ways,
negotiating gas consumption, allowing multi-hop and multi-dex swaps, as well as supporting unlimited AMM strategies
variations for a single pair of assets, but it is also built for developers and businesses.

Combined with a powerful toolset of **swap.coffee**'s products such as **Claiming Center**, [Staking Protocol](/technical-guides/staking-internals) and others,
it grants us an ability to build an all-in-one ecosystem with instant payouts for liquidity providers, referrals and
even B2B integrators; possibility to launch cashback-, farm- or even competition-based campaigns and much, much more.

More than that, **swap.coffee DEX** is not just a protocol - it is a product itself which's built on top of that protocol.
The open-source nature not only provides more transparency to our tech-savvy users who are interested to understand how
things work internally, but also allows other market participants to launch their own **DEX**es backed by contracts developed by us.
