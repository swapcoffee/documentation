This page contains information about entities which are essential for understanding the high-level design of the **swap.coffee DEX**.

## Assets

Every token, currency or fund user wants to swap or deposit as liquidity throughout **swap.coffee DEX** protocol we call an **Asset**.

As for now, protocol supports 3 types of assets (and more may be added in the future).
Each of them corresponds to a unique [TL-B scheme](/technical-guides/dex/tlb-schemes#asset), and they're as follows:

- **native** - our naming for **TON**coin itself.
- **jetton** - any token that corresponds to the [Jetton Standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md) built on TON Blockchain.
- **extra** - tokens that were added to the TON Blockchain as [Extra Currencies](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/dapps/defi/coins#extra-currencies).

While having such an abstraction may seem like an unnecessary complication of the system to some, in fact it allows
us to abstract work with higher-level entities, which we will describe in more detail in the [contracts section](#contracts).

## AMM Strategies

AMM (or Automated Market Maker) strategies are a class of algorithms that sustain pools' asset reserves and
mathematically ensure that trades are being performed at a fair (for all participants) price, that no more money is
taken out of the **DEX** than was invested in it and a lot of other more-technical things.

Each pool is uniquely identified by its assets pair, AMM strategy and AMM settings. It means that within a single implementation of
a **swap.coffee DEX** there could not exist two pools of the same AMM strategy, AMM settings and, for example, an assets pair of TON/USDT.

Current implementation supports only 2 AMM strategies described below, however the contracts are already coded to support
more strategies if (when) it will be needed. If you're interested in addition of new AMM strategies, please contact
us via Telegram [@swap.coffee DEV Chat](https://t.me/swapcoffee_dev_chat).

### Constant Product

Either known as "volatile" or "Uniswap" AMM. Ensures that product of pool's reserves remains unchanged after
any swap or liquidity provisioning/withdrawal after pool is initially created.

In other words, if pool's reserves marked as `x` and `y`, their product must equal some predetermined `k = x * y` after
every performed swap. So, for example, if we perform a swap by providing some quantity of first asset marked as `dx`
and want to receive some of the second asset, quantity of second asset, marked as `dy`, must be calculated from
the formula `x * y = (x + dx) * (y - dy)`.

### CurveFi Stable

AMM strategy designed especially for stable-coins like USDT/USDC, prices of which should not differ widely.

On the demand side, it offers a Uniswap-like automated exchange with very low price slippage (typically 100 times
smaller). On the supply side, it offers a multi-stablecoin "savings account" which, according to simulation and
countless production use-cases on other blockchains, can bring 300% APR, assuming that traders will arbitrage
between this AMM strategy and **Constant Product** pools.

More detailed explanation is available in [Curve.Fi's Document](https://docs.curve.fi/assets/pdf/stableswap-paper.pdf).
An example of implementation may be found on [Curve.Fi's Repository](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/master/contracts/pools/eurs/StableSwapEURS.vy).

Our implementation also supports assets weights, one of common use-cases for which is to normalize pool's assets
whenever they have different values of decimals.

## Contracts

**swap.coffee DEX** protocol introduces contracts of 5 (and a half) different types, which are described below.

### Factory

The "heart" of the protocol. It serves three purposes:

1. To deploy any other contracts within the same installation of **swap.coffee DEX**.
2. To be an entry-point for any administrative actions. Any time administrator wants to perform one of them, he sends message not to the destination contract, but proxies it throughout the **Factory**.
3. And by being the central part in the security of inter-contract communications. They do not proxy their messages throughout the **Factory**, but it serves as a "cryptographic key" when they sign and verify messages of each other.

#### Init

This is that "half" we wrote above :)

Every time **Factory** is about to deploy a new contract, it actually deploys this **Init** contract,
followed by a command to overwrite its code and data cells with those that correspond to an actual type of contract
**Factory** wanted to deploy.

Such mechanism is being used because of how addresses work in TON blockchain: they depend on the code and data cells
with which contract was initially deployed; and especially because of such behaviour it is possible to utilize inter-contract
security system we developed within our protocol.

### Vault

**Vaults** are main entry points for users: every time you want to perform a swap, create new pool or deposit a liquidity,
you will send messages to the **Vaults**. They receive your assets, keep them on their side, and redirect your request via
inter-contract communication down the road. Whenever another contract decides it's time to process a payout for you, it
sends an inter-contract message to the corresponding **Vault**, and after that you receive a payment.

**Vault** itself, as a naming, is a declaration of not a contract source code, but of a type (or rather interface) of contracts.
Each asset type has its own implementation of **Vault** contract, therefore there are 3 of them:

- **Native Vault** - there is only one, and it serves as a treasury for **TON**coin.
- **Jetton Vaults** - there is one for every **Jetton** our there.
- **Extra Vaults** - similarly to **Jetton Vaults**, there is one for every **Extra Currency** in TON Blockchain; but also similarly to **Native Vault** it accepts direct messages (i.e. transactions) from the users, whilst **Jetton Vaults** react to payloads from jetton transfer notifications.

### Pool

Unlike **Vaults**, all the **Pools** share the same codebase: it's a single contract source code.
As described below, they're being uniquely identified by the asset pair, AMM strategy type and AMM settings.

Users don't directly communicate with the **Pools** on-chain: they support only inter-contract communication.

### PoolCreator and LiquidityDepository

These two utility contract types are being used as a user's personal treasury anytime
he is trying to create new pool or deposit some liquidity.

They're being created by inter-contract communication after you already sent your assets to the corresponding **Vaults**,
and they auto-destroy after process of new pool creation or liquidity provisioning comes to an end.
