**📈 Mindful Investments Anytime**

Investing is an art of balance. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) allows you to automatically buy or sell assets within predefined ranges, reducing the risks associated with market fluctuations.

On swap.coffee, you set a price range within which the system will execute orders at a predetermined frequency.

## 🚀 How Does It Work?

1. **Choose an asset** — for example, CES.
2. **Define a price range** — for instance, TON $2.00 – $2.50.
3. **Set the frequency of trades** — for example, every day at 12:00 UTC.
4. swap.coffee automatically executes trades, even when you're offline.

## 🔍 Additional DCA Settings

### 📌 Maximum Number of Executions

This parameter determines how many times the system can execute an order before the strategy is terminated.

- **1 execution** — the order is executed once and then turned off.
- **10 executions** — the system repeats the purchase up to 10 times, after which the strategy is terminated.

**Example:**
If you want to buy CES every 12 hours, but only 5 times, you set the maximum number of executions to 5. After the fifth trade, the system will automatically stop executing.

### 📌 Order Splitting Multiplier

This parameter splits the trade into several parts to optimize the price and reduce market impact.

- **Multiplier 1** — the order is executed as one large lot.
- **Multiplier 3** — the trade is divided into 3 parts, each executed separately.
- **Multiplier 5** — the purchase/sale is divided into 5 parts and executed over the specified interval.

**Example:**
If you want to buy 100 CES but don't want a single large order to affect the market, setting the multiplier to 5 will split the order into 5 parts of 20 CES each. As a result, the price will be averaged and the purchase will be less noticeable in the market.

## 🛡 Security and Decentralization

- ✔️ DCA is fully automated — you don't need to manually execute trades.
- ✔️ Smart contracts are used, ensuring maximum transparency.

## 🔥 DCA is a strategy for those who want to invest without stress and with maximum efficiency.
