**📊 Automatic trades under your conditions**

Limit orders allow you to set in advance the price at which you want to buy or sell an asset.

Forget constant market monitoring — swap.coffee will execute the trade automatically as soon as the price reaches the set level.

## 🚀 How do limit orders work?

1. **Choose an asset** — for example, CES.
2. **Set the price at which you want to buy or sell** — for instance, TON at $2.30.
3. **Create a limit order.**
4. As soon as the price reaches the required level, swap.coffee automatically executes the order.

You control every trade and are not at the mercy of chance.

## 🔍 Additional Limit Order Settings

### 📌 Maximum Number of Executions

Determines how many times the system can repeat the order if the price is not reached.

- **1 execution** — the order is triggered once.
- **10 executions** — the system repeats the order up to 10 times if the price is not reached.

**Example:**
You place a limit order to sell CES at $1.50 but do not want to sell the entire amount immediately. If you set the maximum number of executions to 5, swap.coffee will attempt to sell CES at that price 5 times before terminating the order.

### 📌 Sub-Order Multiplier

Splits the order into several parts, reducing its impact on the price.

- **Multiplier 1** — the order is executed as one whole lot.
- **Multiplier 3** — the order is split into 3 parts, each executed separately.
- **Multiplier 5** — the trade is divided into 5 parts, reducing market load.

**Example:**
You want to sell 10,000 CES, but you do not want to provoke a price drop. With a multiplier of 4, swap.coffee will split the sale into 4 orders of 2,500 CES, minimizing the market impact.

## 🛡 Security and Decentralization

- ✔️ Orders are executed via smart contracts, without intermediaries.
- ✔️ Full transparency of order execution on the blockchain.

## 🔥 Limit orders are a smart way to trade without constantly monitoring the market.
