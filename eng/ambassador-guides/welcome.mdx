## General Tips for All Video Platforms

Regardless of the platform, remember: you're working within recommendation systems. Algorithms determine whether someone will see your content. To increase your reach:

- Post daily or as regularly as possible — social networks reward consistency.
- Introduce content series: reviews, news, debates, hacks, personal experience, analytics.
- Repurpose content across all platforms. There are tools for automatic cross-platform posting — use them.
- Grow as a media personality: follow successful channels, adopt best practices, and ensure high content quality.
- Treat your growth like a real job — pay attention to details, analytics, engagement, and audience response. Remember: without persistence and consistent work, success won't come. Be disciplined and don’t quit after the first challenge — and you will see results.
- Record detailed video reviews of the platform and highlight its unique features: no fees, high speed, intuitive UI, and the best market prices. Post educational guides regularly, from basic tools to advanced features.
- Use hooks and clickbait-style titles — they help boost views.
- The first 5–10 seconds of the video are crucial to capture viewer attention. Start strong: bold visuals, intriguing questions, or a teaser of what’s coming. Avoid long intros — viewers might leave before the content starts.
- It's not just about attracting viewers, but also retaining their attention. YouTube considers this in its algorithms, so check YouTube Analytics regularly (e.g., average watch time and retention rate). Analyze where viewers drop off and improve based on that. Adjust video length, editing, and delivery to keep viewers watching longer.
- Thumbnails are your storefront. Make them eye-catching with bold, readable fonts. Don’t place text in the bottom-right corner — it may get covered by the YouTube timestamp. Experiment with different thumbnails — YouTube allows changing them after publication. Track which designs perform best. Pro tip: analyze what works for top crypto creators and adapt it for your own style.
- Ensure high video quality and clean audio — this builds trust. Use AI tools like Adobe Enhance Speech or alternatives to polish audio. You can also use Audacity or Adobe Audition to adjust volume, reduce noise, and balance levels. Clean, professional audio improves viewer experience and boosts full-watch probability.
- In descriptions, include timestamps, useful links, and calls-to-action (visit the website, join the community, etc.). Add in-depth analysis and insights about the platform. While tags no longer play a huge role, it’s still good practice to include them. Focus on titles, thumbnails, and strong hooks.

Cut your long videos into multiple short clips and post them across all social platforms. This format helps reach a new audience and adapt content to Reels, Shorts, and TikTok. If you don’t want to create full-length videos — focus on vertical formats. The rules stay the same: engaging hook, dynamic editing, clear sound, and a strong topic.
